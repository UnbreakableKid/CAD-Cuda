# Labs of the CAD course from MIEI@DI-FCT-UNL

- Lab1 (src/lab) - Sequential implementation of the all pairs solution for the NBody problem.
- Lab2 (src/lab2 and test/lab2) - Parallel, OpenMP-based, implementation of the all pairs solution for the NBody problem.
- Lab3 (src/lab3 and test/lab3) - Parallel, CUDA-based, implementation of the container pairwise addition.
Codebase for a CUDA-based implementation of the all pairs solution for the NBody problem.
